Task Documentation: Simple Python Chatbot

1. Objective:

The objective of this task is to create a simple chatbot program in Python that engages in conversation with the user by responding to predefined queries and providing appropriate responses.

2. Implementation:

The chatbot program is implemented using Python programming language.
The program consists of a single function named chatbot() that serves as the main chatbot logic.
Within the chatbot() function, the program greets the user and then enters a loop to continuously interact with the user until the user decides to exit.
The program prompts the user for input and processes the input to determine the appropriate response.
The chatbot provides predefined responses to specific queries such as greetings, inquiries about its well-being, and questions about its identity.
The chatbot also provides a mechanism for the user to exit the conversation by typing "exit".

3. Functionality:

chatbot():
Greets the user with an introductory message.
Enters a loop to continuously interact with the user.
Prompts the user for input and converts it to lowercase for case insensitivity.
Responds to specific user inputs with predefined responses.
Provides a default response for unrecognized inputs.
Allows the user to exit the conversation by typing "exit".
Terminates the conversation and bids farewell when the user chooses to exit.

4. Usage:

To use the chatbot, execute the Python script containing the provided code.
The chatbot will greet the user and wait for input.
Enter queries or messages to interact with the chatbot.
The chatbot will respond according to the predefined responses or prompt for clarification if the input is not recognized.
To end the conversation, type "exit" and press Enter.

5. Error Handling:

The chatbot program does not perform complex input validation or error handling as it focuses on basic conversation interactions.
However, it gracefully handles the exit command and provides appropriate responses to recognized and unrecognized inputs.

6. Conclusion:

The implemented simple chatbot program provides a basic framework for engaging in conversations with users.
While it lacks advanced natural language processing capabilities, it demonstrates the fundamental principles of chatbot design and interaction.
Users can engage in simple conversations with the chatbot, receive predefined responses, and exit the conversation at their discretion.
